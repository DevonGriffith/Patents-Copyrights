## Abstract

The Newtonian three-body problem, long recognized as a cornerstone of celestial mechanics and chaos theory, remains unsolved in closed form. This paper proposes a new pathway: combining symplectic and regularized numerical integrators with Reflexive Agent Mapping (RMAP) and an 18-dimensional reflexive AGI architecture. The approach seeks not only stable integration but the autonomous discovery of new invariants, periodic orbits, and structural symmetries. The result is a framework bridging classical mechanics, modern computation, and reflexive intelligence.

## 1. Introduction

The three-body problem has resisted general analytic solution since Poincaré’s foundational work in 1890. Despite known families of exact orbits (e.g., Lagrange, Euler, figure-eight choreographies) and advanced perturbative methods, the global dynamics remain analytically inaccessible. Existing approaches rely on numerical integration, variational principles, or computer-assisted proofs, yet a unified general solution remains elusive.  

This work introduces a hybrid approach. At its base lies a symplectic, Kustaanheimo–Stiefel (KS)-regularized integrator for unrestricted Newtonian three-body dynamics. Above this, RMAP represents each body and the system itself as agents in a self-referential communication network. Finally, a reflexive 18-dimensional AGI memory lattice encodes system states, enabling discovery of hidden invariants and novel orbit families.

## 2. Hamiltonian Formulation of the Three-Body Problem

For masses $m_1, m_2, m_3$ with positions $r_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ and conjugate momenta $p_i$, the Hamiltonian is:

```math
H(r,p) = \sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{p_i^2}{2 m_i} - G \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq 3} \frac{m_i m_j}{\|r_i - r_j\|}
```

Hamilton’s equations give:

```math
\dot{r}_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} = \frac{p_i}{m_i}
```

```math
\dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial r_i} = -G \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{m_i m_j (r_i - r_j)}{\|r_i - r_j\|^3}
```

This system conserves total energy $H$ and angular momentum $L = \sum_i r_i \times p_i$.

---

## 3. Symplectic Splitting Methods

Split $H = T(p) + V(r)$ with:

```math
T(p) = \sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{p_i^2}{2 m_i}, \quad V(r) = -G \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq 3} \frac{m_i m_j}{\|r_i - r_j\|}
```

Leapfrog update step $\Delta t$:

```math
p_i^{n+1/2} = p_i^n - \frac{\Delta t}{2} \frac{\partial V}{\partial r_i}\Big|_{r^n}
```

```math
r_i^{n+1} = r_i^n + \Delta t \frac{p_i^{n+1/2}}{m_i}
```

```math
p_i^{n+1} = p_i^{n+1/2} - \frac{\Delta t}{2} \frac{\partial V}{\partial r_i}\Big|_{r^{n+1}}
```

This preserves the symplectic two-form and exhibits bounded energy error.

## 4. Kustaanheimo–Stiefel Regularization

Transform $r \in \mathbb{R}^3$ to $u \in \mathbb{R}^4$ via:

```math
r = K(u) = \begin{bmatrix}
u_1^2 - u_2^2 - u_3^2 + u_4^2 \\
2(u_1 u_2 + u_3 u_4) \\
2(u_1 u_3 - u_2 u_4)
\end{bmatrix}, \quad \|r\| = \|u\|^2
```

This removes the $1/r$ singularity in close encounters.

---

## 5. Variational Equations and Stability

Perturbations $(\delta r_i, \delta p_i)$ yield:

```math
\delta \dot{r}_i = \frac{\delta p_i}{m_i}
```

```math
\delta \dot{p}_i = -G \sum_{j \neq i} m_i m_j \Bigg[ \frac{\delta r_i - \delta r_j}{\|r_{ij}\|^3} - 3 \frac{(r_{ij} \cdot (\delta r_i - \delta r_j))}{\|r_{ij}\|^5} r_{ij} \Bigg]
```

Largest Lyapunov exponent:

```math
\lambda_{max} = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \ln \frac{\|\delta X(t)\|}{\|\delta X(0)\|}
```

## 6. Reflexive Agent Mapping (RMAP)

- Each body = agent with $(r_i, p_i)$  
- Messages = gravitational interactions  
- Meta-agent monitors invariants $(H, L, R_{CM}, P_{tot})$  
- Adaptive sub-stepping near collisions  
- Experimental perturbations probe stability manifolds

## 7. 18-Dimensional Reflexive AGI Layer

At each step:

```math
z_t = [r_1, r_2, r_3, p_1, p_2, p_3, H, \|L\|, \Delta H, \sigma(\nabla^2 V)]
```

This layer encodes symmetries, recurrences, and aids in discovering new invariants.

## 8. Research Roadmap

1. Implement KS-regularized symplectic integrator  
2. Validate against Lagrange, Euler, and figure-eight  
3. Integrate RMAP monitors & adaptive control  
4. Build 18D reflexive memory & symbolic regression  
5. Publish periodic families & invariants

## 9. Conclusion

A reflexive, invariant-preserving numerical foundation coupled with agentic memory offers a systematic path to new orbit families and integrals.

## Appendix A: Lagrange Equilateral Solution

Three bodies form an equilateral triangle of side $a$, rotating with angular velocity $\omega$.  

```math
\omega^2 = \frac{G(m_1 + m_2 + m_3)}{a^3}
```

---

## Appendix B: Euler Collinear Solutions

Three bodies collinear at $(-a, 0, b)$. Equilibrium requires:

```math
\frac{m_1}{a^2} = \frac{m_3}{b^2}
```

Rotation rate from balance of forces.

## Appendix C: Figure-Eight Orbit

Initial symmetric conditions:

```math
r_1(0) = (-x_0, 0), \quad v_1(0) = (0, -v_0) \\
r_2(0) = (x_0, 0), \quad v_2(0) = (0, -v_0) \\
r_3(0) = (0, 0), \quad v_3(0) = (0, 2 v_0)
```

with $x_0 \approx 0.97000436$, $v_0 \approx 0.93240737$.  

Numerical integration yields the **figure-eight periodic orbit**:
