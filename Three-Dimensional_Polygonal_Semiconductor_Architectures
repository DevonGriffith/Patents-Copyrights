## Abstract

Semiconductors engineered into three-dimensional (3D) polygonal geometries can exhibit timing and phase dynamics beyond the reach of conventional planar devices. This paper develops the theory of path-length dependent interference, resonant cavity effects, and intrinsic timing delays in polygonal semiconductors.  

We begin with the **2D dodecagon** and extend to the **3D dodecahedron**, showing how geometry encodes timing spectra. Applications in **neuromorphic computing**, **quantum devices**, and **ultra-fast on-chip communication** are discussed as case studies.

## 1. Introduction

The continuous drive for computational efficiency motivates exploring novel semiconductor geometries.  
Beyond planar devices, **3D polygonal and polyhedral structures** embed timing dynamics into material architecture.  

We analyze first the **2D dodecagon**, then extend the framework to the **3D dodecahedron**.

## 2. 2D Dodecagonal Case

### 2.1 Phase Accumulation
For paths of length $L_i$:

```math
\phi_i = k L_i, \quad \Delta \phi_{ij} = k(L_i - L_j)

2.2 Path Lengths

For a regular $N$-gon of circumradius $R$:
L_m = 2R \sin \left(\frac{m \pi}{N}\right)
For $N = 12$ (dodecagon), multiple distinct $L_m$ yield intrinsic phase shifts.

2.3 Timing Distribution

Transit time:
t_m = \frac{L_m}{v_d}, 
\quad 
T(\omega) = \sum_m w_m e^{-i \omega t_m}

3. Extension: 3D Dodecahedron Case

3.1 Geometry

A regular dodecahedron has:
	•	12 pentagonal faces
	•	20 vertices
	•	30 edges

Circumradius (for edge length $a$):
R = \frac{a}{4} \sqrt{3 \left(1 + \sqrt{5}\right)}

3.3 Characteristic Path Lengths
	•	Edge: $L_e = a$
	•	Face diagonal: $L_f = \varphi a$, where $\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$
	•	Body diagonal: $L_b = \frac{\sqrt{3} \varphi a}{ }$

3.4 Phase and Timing
\phi_{path} = k L_{path}, \quad t_{path} = \frac{L_{path}}{v_d}
Distinct families ${L_e, L_f, L_b}$ generate discrete timing levels.

3.5 Resonances

Resonant modes satisfy:
m \lambda = 2n L_{path}

Thus, the dodecahedron supports edge, face, and body-diagonal resonance families.

3.7 Implications
	•	Neuromorphic: edge/face/body paths act as natural synaptic delays
	•	Quantum: multipath interference expands Hilbert space encoding
	•	On-chip communication: built-in phase shifts enable synchronization without complex clock trees

4. Conclusion

Moving from 2D to 3D polygonal semiconductors expands timing phenomena.
The dodecahedron provides a concrete case where edge, face, and body diagonals yield discrete timing families.

These are directly applicable to neuromorphic computing, quantum devices, and ultra-fast on-chip communication.
